            <h2>Student at North Island College</h2>

            <p>
              I have always loved art even as a young child. I remember
              collecting supplies and experimenting at home, taking as many art
              classes as I could, and even spending time in the art rooms when I
              wasn't in a formal class. I bounced between art styles, projects,
              and types, for years, never really finding the one thing that I
              really liked and passing it off as a hobby I only dabbled in while
              I worked low level jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I went to BCIT and got a Marketing Degree. I realized that it
              wasn't for me when my favourite class was Ad Design and I loathed
              all the others. That led me to NIC and their Design and
              Development prorgram. I have loved every moment of it. Being able
              to balance logic and creativity has been so fulfilling.

            <h3>Elfinlau</h3>
            <p>
              After coming across this absolutely ridiculous website in one of
              my marketing classes at BCIT, when I got tasked with re-designing
              a website for DGL 103, I knew exactly which one to tackle. After
              finding some inspiration from other luxury resorts, I took a crack
              at it. Not so bad for having very limited HTML and CSS knowledge!
              While not perfect, I still think my design proves to be a little
              more appealing than the original.

              Sebastian is quite important to me. Unfortunately, he no longer
              blesses this world with his presence, but the time we spent
              together was so valuable to me. Drawing him is one of the many
              ways I get to honour his existence and work through my grief.
              Drawing this in charcoal was well out of my comfort zone, but I
              had so much fun doing it.

            <p>
              I took DGL 102 last semester and my Term Project was to create a
              poster for a social justice cause in the style of a famous digital
              artist. The cause I chose was invasive species and their impact on
              native ecosystems. This was partially becuase of my volunteering
              with the amazing ISCBC or Invasive Species Council of BC. You can
              learn more about all the amazing things they are doing

              >
              The digital artist that I chose was Christopher Dina who is an
              American digital artist that lives and works in Japan. You can
              find out more about him by visiting his website

            <h3>Energy</h3>
            <p>
              I took FIN 110 last semester and loved it. One of my favourite
              projects was continuous line drawing. I really took to this style
              as it let me explore art in a way that I hadn't before and I
              didn't get hung up on mistakes. Energy is a continuous line
              drawing of two hands, one on top and one on the bottom, curled
              towards each other with a single thin line connecting them. I
              truly believe that energy is something you can see and feel,
              especially when you put intent into it.

              I am currently in my 3rd Semester of my degree. I am doing it part
              time while I work, so I expect it to take me 4 years instead of 3
              but I am ok with a better work, school, and life balance even if
              it means one extra year of school. In my first year I was awarded
              the $500 DIGITAL Design + Development Women in Technology Bursary
              and the $590 Bob Minkler Memorial Bursary. This year I was awarded
